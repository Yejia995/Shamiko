## Shamiko

A minimal tile switch for Shamiko whitelist.

### Build
```
chmod +x gradlew
sh gradlew build
```

### Usage
Pull down the notification bar, find `Shamiko` in the quick settings panel and add it to the tiles. The app will immediately request root permissions, so please make sure that `Shamiko` is not in whitelist mode at this time.
